# Personal Website Implementing NodeJS and AWS EC2 Instance

###Introduction
Just working on my NodeJS and JavaScript skills by using a Bootstrap theme and constructing a **DEMO** personal website - version 0.0 :zero:

###Tools :triangular_ruler::hammer:
**NodeJS** - used to run the backend server
**AWS** (Free Tier) EC2 instance - kept my website running
**Dynadot** - hosted my EC2 instance on a custom domain

###Thoughts :cloud:
I had really fun going through just the basic struggles of trying to publish a website. It was my first time, but I enjoyed learning how these different tools can work together. You can check it out at [link to nafisasarowar.com](http://nafisasarowar.com/)

###Improvements :bookmark_tabs:
Definitely going to stick with a standard website and create an improved website in the future.
